### :man_technologist: About Me:
Hi there! I'm Vladislav. I am Android developer from Belarus. Development for me isn't only a job, but also a hobby. I often spend my free time writing own small projects, reading interesting articles or learning new technologies.
I plan to move up the career ladder in the shortest posible time and earn a good reputation in the field of IT!
